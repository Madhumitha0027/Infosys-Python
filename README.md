## ✅ Task 1 – Parallel Text Processor

In this task, I developed a Python-based Parallel Text Processing application to demonstrate file handling, database integration, and basic parallel computing concepts.

### 🔹 Implementation
- Designed and initialized a SQLite database to store sample records
- Implemented file handling to read and preprocess text data
- Performed basic text analysis by calculating total lines and words
- Applied data chunking to split large text into smaller segments
- Utilized Python multiprocessing (Pool) to execute parallel processing

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python | sqlite3 | multiprocessing
